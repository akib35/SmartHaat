\section*{Name Of the Project}
"SmartHaat"
\section*{Objectives}
A platform that helps the community by --
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item Connecting both consumer and provider for halal cattles in a single platform.
\item Colaborating with farmars from rural areas as well as with agro farm.
\item Offering livestock animals in a convenient way all year.
\item Spreading the rules and regulation of udhiyah(Qurbani) according to reliable islamic scholars.
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Description}
Qurbani or udhiyah is an important Islamic practice of sacrificing a halal animal during the festival of Eid ul-Adha. And it's still a manual as well as tough job to buy a cattle from market in this digital era. Although there are some social media groups and websites which are not doing a great job in terms of good consumer service. With all due limitations of those parties, it is necessary to develop a practical and more iteractive platfrom on this regards.
\subsection*{The Idea : Scope and Scheme}
The platform we intend to devlop needs to offer a good amount of  livestock animals from local supplier as well as farms.There will be detailed information about the cattle's breed, birth, food, weight, approximate meat etc.

The interconnection of customer and supplier can be developed on either giving the supplier detailed information where customer can contact by himself or we can devlop a payment system.


The payment system includes the basic payment methods of local areas and the perspective of loyalty can ba achieved by providing COD or CIA technique and others.

A good content such as video lectures on Qurbani can be useful. Therefore, writings, quotes, clips from renowned scholars can be added.

Finally, cattle food, feedback, instant chat, butcher service also can be a part of the platform.

\subsection*{The Website : Features and Functionality}

The website is expected to have various functionality based on the idea and the requirements of the project. Firstly, the information about the cattles with necessary data (such as weight, breed, foods etc.) added by the farmers a.k.a. users will be included. These data will be available to be sorted using the parameters provided.

A section of featured content- video, audio, fatwa as blog provided by established and renowned scholars based on the rules of shariah of udhiyah will be available.
There will be widget on the details page of the animals where the price will be shown \& anyone have to pay the given price to purchase.%as there shouldn't be any bidding opitons due to owner's pofit purpose as we will set prices with low profit for customer's satisfaction.

Furthermore, the payment system via online banking such as rocket, bkash, anything similar platfrom will be included. And a instant chatting system or forum will be available for quick response with the moderators.

\section*{Development Platfroms}
The frameworks and language platforms we are supposed to use --
\begin{itemize}
	\item HTML
	\item CSS
	\item JAVASCRIPT
	\item PHP
	\item SQL
\item Flutter, etc
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
One of the motives of our platfrom is to provide a convenient way of practicing an important aspect of islam for muslim ummah. Again the platform can provide easy solution to our community by reducing time and money.
