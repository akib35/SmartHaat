\caption{Firms page}
\label{firms}
\end{figure}

As we can see in the figure \ref{firms} shows the list of firms. Therefore, we also implemented a system where users can register their farms. With necessary information, a firm can be registered and after verification it can be displayed.

\end{figure}
Here, butcher is supplied using the nearest location possible and free time is also a necessary condition. After these conditions are met by user, we can provide butchers.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

One of the unique feature of our website was blogging system, where we could incorporate good writings of various scholars on different regards. Following figure \ref{blog} offers similar kind of feature.


In order to add post there is a post submitting page. In figure \ref{post} it shows an inner view of blog posts where digital media such as videos, audios images as well as text can be added.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

There is a wishlist page where a product can be saved which can be further be added to cart and order. The wishlist page is shown in figure \ref{wlst}, where it has product details, add to cart option and remove option.
\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{figure}[H]

\section*{Conclusion}
``SmartHaat'' website offers a basic kind of e-commerce experience with some special features on am unique concept. The main goals were to provide the users expected features in a modern UI. Therefore, easy and quick responsive pages are built for our website.

This week we improved various pages with more functionalities and features. The payment page took a bit of difficulty, but it was solved finally. And there are also some small unfinished tasks which could be solved. Some data can't be accessed without proper APIs and that's why some functions are not available.
There are some server issue for which some parts don't work sometimes which also solved after many attempts.
